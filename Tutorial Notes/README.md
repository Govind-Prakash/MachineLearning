# MachineLearning

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!

This repository serves as a collection of my learning journey, notes, and implementations of various machine learning models and techniques. It includes detailed explanations, code examples, and applications for popular algorithms such as:

Linear Regression: Understanding and implementing regression models for predicting continuous outcomes.
Logistic Regression: Applying regression models to classify binary and multiclass outcomes.
Decision Trees: Exploring tree-based models for both classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest: Implementing ensemble methods to improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Gradient Boosting: Leveraging boosting techniques for highly accurate predictions using algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM.
This repository is continually updated as I expand my knowledge of machine learning. It is designed for both personal reference and to help others understand these foundational models. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the code for your projects.

Letâ€™s build and learn together!
